<h1 style="text-align:center;">MY WEB OPINIONS</h1>
I know that the cyber security is really important in the future because "With the internet of things (IoT) and connected devices proliferating at such an incredible rate, the ways in which we leave ourselves exposed to potential cyber attacks are also increasing" <a href="https://www.disruptordaily.com/future-of-cybersecurity/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20future%20of%20cybersecurity%20will%20have%20a%20heavy%20focus%20on,in%20the%20increasingly%20connected%20world.&text=Capable%20automated%20systems%20that%20can,what%20drives%20cybersecurity%20going%20forward.%E2%80%9D">Disruptor</a>. Cyber security is "Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks" <a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cyber-security">kaspersky</a>. In my opinion cyber security should be the most imporatnt thing that should be maintained in the future so people wouldn't get hacked easily.
