<h1 style="text-align:center;">MY WEB OPINIONS</h1>
<p>I know that the cyber security is really important in the future because "With the internet of things (IoT) and connected devices proliferating at such an incredible rate, the ways in which we leave ourselves exposed to potential cyber attacks are also increasing" <a href="https://www.disruptordaily.com/future-of-cybersecurity/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20future%20of%20cybersecurity%20will%20have%20a%20heavy%20focus%20on,in%20the%20increasingly%20connected%20world.&text=Capable%20automated%20systems%20that%20can,what%20drives%20cybersecurity%20going%20forward.%E2%80%9D">(Disruptor)</a>. Cyber security is "the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks" <a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cyber-security">(kaspersky)</a>. In my opinion cyber security should be the most imporatnt thing that should be maintained in the future so people wouldn't get hacked easily.</p>

<p>I think that cloud computing will grow a lot more in the future because "Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services -- from applications to storage and processing power -- typically over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis" <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-cloud-computing-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-cloud/">(zdnet)</a>. People can access their stuff in the internet without using the same device and in my opinion it will grow a lot more in the future because of people constantly switching devices.
  
<p>Voice user interfaces (VUIs) allow the user to interact with a system through voice or speech commands <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/voice-user-interfaces">(Interaction design foundation)</a>. All five of the “Big Five” tech companies — Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook — have developed (or are currently developing) voice-enabled AI assistants <a href="https://uxplanet.org/designing-a-vui-voice-user-interface-c0b3b9b57ace">(UX planet)</a> In my opinion VUIs will be future because big tech companies are constatly developing it and each time they release a new device that device has been improved from their last gen. devices.

<p>Internet of Things is constatly growing and I think that is good but "The Internet of Things — IoT, for short — is made up of devices that connect to the internet and share data with each other" <a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-iot-5-predictions-for-the-future-of-iot.html">(Norton)</a>. Which would make cities more smart but security would be harder to maintain due to a lot of devices that are connected.
